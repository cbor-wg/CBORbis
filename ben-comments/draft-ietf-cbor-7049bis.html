<p>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation. These design goals make it different from earlier binary serializations such as ASN.1 and MessagePack.</p>
<p>This document is a revised edition of RFC 7049, with editorial improvements, added detail, and fixed errata.  This revision formally obsoletes RFC 7049, while keeping full compatibility of the interchange format from RFC 7049.  It does not create a new version of the format.</p>
<h1><a>Contributing</a></h1>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">There are hundreds of standardized formats for binary representation of structured data (also known as binary serialization formats).  Of those, some are for specific domains of information, while others are generalized for arbitrary data.  In the IETF, probably the best-known formats in the latter category are ASN.1&#8217;s BER and DER <a href="#ASN.1" class="xref">[ASN.1]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">The format defined here follows some specific design goals that are not well met by current formats.  The underlying data model is an extended version of the JSON data model <a href="#RFC8259" class="xref">[RFC8259]</a>.  It is important to note that this is not a proposal that the grammar in RFC 8259 be extended in general, since doing so would cause a significant backwards incompatibility with already deployed JSON documents. Instead, this document simply defines its own data model that starts from JSON.</p>
<p><a href="#comparison-app" class="xref">Appendix E</a> lists some existing binary formats and discusses how well they do or do not fit the design objectives of the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">This document is a revised edition of <a href="#RFC7049" class="xref">[RFC7049]</a>, with editorial improvements, added detail, and fixed errata.  This revision formally obsoletes RFC 7049, while keeping full compatibility of the interchange format from RFC 7049.  It does not create a new version of the format.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.1">The objectives of CBOR, roughly in decreasing order of importance, are:</p>
<p></p>

<ol>
<li>The representation must be able to unambiguously encode most common data formats used in Internet standards.  <ul>
<li>It must represent a reasonable set of basic data types and structures using binary encoding.  &#8220;Reasonable&#8221; here is largely influenced by the capabilities of JSON, with the major addition of binary byte strings.  The structures supported are limited to arrays and trees; loops and lattice-style graphs are not supported.</li>
<li>There is no requirement that all data formats be uniquely encoded; that is, it is acceptable that the number &#8220;7&#8221; might be encoded in multiple different ways.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The code for an encoder or decoder must be able to be compact in order to support systems with very limited memory, processor power, and instruction sets.  <ul>
<li>An encoder and a decoder need to be implementable in a very small amount of code (for example, in class 1 constrained nodes as defined in <a href="#RFC7228" class="xref">[RFC7228]</a>).</li>
<li>The format should use contemporary machine representations of data (for example, not requiring binary-to-decimal conversion).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Data must be able to be decoded without a schema description.  <ul><li>Similar to JSON, encoded data should be self-describing so that a generic decoder can be written.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>The serialization must be reasonably compact, but data compactness is secondary to code compactness for the encoder and decoder.  <ul><li>&#8220;Reasonable&#8221; here is bounded by JSON as an upper bound in size, and by the implementation complexity limiting how much effort can go into achieving that compactness.  Using either general compression schemes or extensive bit-fiddling violates the complexity goals.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>The format must be applicable to both constrained nodes and high-volume applications.  <ul><li>This means it must be reasonably frugal in CPU usage for both encoding and decoding.  This is relevant both for constrained nodes and for potential usage in applications with a very high volume of data.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>The format must support all JSON data types for conversion to and from JSON.  <ul><li>It must support a reasonable level of conversion as long as the data represented is within the capabilities of JSON.  It must be possible to define a unidirectional mapping towards JSON for all types of data.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>The format must be extensible, and the extended data must be decodable by earlier decoders.  <ul>
<li>The format is designed for decades of use.</li>
<li>The format must support a form of extensibility that allows fallback so that a decoder that does not understand an extension can still decode the message.</li>
<li>The format must be able to be extended in the future by later IETF standards.</li>
</ul>

<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.2">The term &#8220;byte&#8221; is used in its now-customary sense as a synonym for &#8220;octet&#8221;. All multi-byte values are encoded in network byte order (that is, most significant byte first, also known as &#8220;big-endian&#8221;).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.3">This specification makes use of the following terminology:</p>
<p></p>

<dl>
<dt>Data item:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">A single piece of CBOR data.  The structure of a data item may contain zero, one, or more nested data items.  The term is used both for the data item in representation format and for the abstract idea that can be derived from that by a decoder; the former can be addressed specifically by using &#8220;encoded data item&#8221;.</dd>
<dt>Decoder:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">A process that decodes a well-formed encoded CBOR data item and makes it available to an application.  Formally speaking, a decoder contains a parser to break up the input using the syntax rules of CBOR, as well as a semantic processor to prepare the data in a form suitable to the application.</dd>
<dt>Encoder:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">A process that generates the (well-formed) representation format of a CBOR data item from application information.</dd>
<dt>Data Stream:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">A sequence of zero or more data items, not further assembled into a larger containing data item (see <a href="#RFC8742" class="xref">[RFC8742]</a> for one application).  The independent data items that make up a data stream are sometimes also referred to as &#8220;top-level data items&#8221;.</dd>
<dt>Well-formed:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">A data item that follows the syntactic structure of CBOR.  A well-formed data item uses the initial bytes and the byte strings and/or data items that are implied by their values as defined in CBOR and does not include following extraneous data. CBOR decoders by definition only return contents from well-formed data items.</dd>
<dt>Valid:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">A data item that is well-formed and also follows the semantic restrictions that apply to CBOR data items (<a href="#semantic-errors" class="xref">Section 5.3</a>).</dd>
<dt>Expected:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">Besides its normal English meaning, the term &#8220;expected&#8221; is used to describe requirements beyond CBOR validity that an application has on its input data.  Well-formed (processable at all), valid (checked by a validity-checking generic decoder), and expected (checked by the application) form a hierarchy of layers of acceptability.</dd>
<dt>Stream decoder:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">A process that decodes a data stream and makes each of the data items in the sequence available to an application as they are received.</dd>
</dl>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.5">Terms and concepts for floating-point values such as Infinity, NaN (not a number), negative zero, and subnormal are defined in <a href="#IEEE754" class="xref">[IEEE754]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.6">Where bit arithmetic or data types are explained, this document uses the notation familiar from the programming language C <a href="#C" class="xref">[C]</a>, except that &#8220;**&#8221; denotes exponentiation.  Examples and pseudocode assume that signed integers use two&#8217;s complement representation and that right shifts of signed integers perform sign extension; these assumptions are also specified in Sections 6.8.2 and 7.6.7 of the 2020 version of C++, successor of <a href="#Cplusplus17" class="xref">[Cplusplus17]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.7">Similar to the &#8220;0x&#8221; notation for hexadecimal numbers, numbers in binary notation are prefixed with &#8220;0b&#8221;.  Underscores can be added to a number solely for readability, so 0b00100001 (0x21) might be written 0b001_00001 to emphasize the desired interpretation of the bits in the byte; in this case, it is split into three bits and five bits.  Encoded CBOR data items are sometimes given in the &#8220;0x&#8221; or &#8220;0b&#8221; notation; these values are first interpreted as numbers as in C and are then interpreted as byte strings in network byte order, including any leading zero bytes expressed in the notation.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.8">Words may be <em>italicized</em> for emphasis; in the plain text form of this specification this is indicated by surrounding words with underscore characters.  Verbatim text (e.g., names from a programming language) may be set in <samp>monospace</samp> type; in plain text this is approximated somewhat ambiguously by surrounding the text in double quotes (which also retain their usual meaning).</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">CBOR is explicit about its generic data model, which defines the set of all data items that can be represented in CBOR.  Its basic generic data model is extensible by the registration of &#8220;simple values&#8221; and tags.  Applications can then subset the resulting extended generic data model to build their specific data models.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.2">Within environments that can represent the data items in the generic data model, generic CBOR encoders and decoders can be implemented (which usually involves defining additional implementation data types for those data items that do not already have a natural representation in the environment).  The ability to provide generic encoders and decoders is an explicit design goal of CBOR; however many applications will provide their own application-specific encoders and/or decoders.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.3">In the basic (un-extended) generic data model, a data item is one of:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>an integer in the range -2**64..2**64-1 inclusive</li>
<li>a simple value, identified by a number between 0 and 255, but distinct from that number itself</li>
<li>a floating-point value, distinct from an integer, out of the set representable by IEEE 754 binary64 (including non-finites) <a href="#IEEE754" class="xref">[IEEE754]</a>
</li>
<li>a sequence of zero or more bytes (&#8220;byte string&#8221;)</li>
<li>a sequence of zero or more Unicode code points (&#8220;text string&#8221;)</li>
<li>a sequence of zero or more data items (&#8220;array&#8221;)</li>
<li>a mapping (mathematical function) from zero or more data items (&#8220;keys&#8221;) each to a data item (&#8220;values&#8221;), (&#8220;map&#8221;)</li>
<li>a tagged data item (&#8220;tag&#8221;), comprising a tag number (an integer in the range 0..2**64-1) and the tag content (a data item)</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.5">Note that integer and floating-point values are distinct in this model, even if they have the same numeric value.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.6">Also note that serialization variants are not visible at the generic data model level, including the number of bytes of the encoded floating-point value or the choice of one of the ways in which an integer, the length of a text or byte string, the number of elements in an array or pairs in a map, or a tag number, (collectively &#8220;the argument&#8221;, see <a href="#encoding" class="xref">Section 3</a>) can be encoded.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.2.1">2.1.</a> <a href="#extended-generic-data-models" id="extended-generic-data-models">Extended Generic Data Models</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.1">This basic generic data model comes pre-extended by the registration of a number of simple values and tag numbers right in this document, such as:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>
<samp>false</samp>, <samp>true</samp>, <samp>null</samp>, and <samp>undefined</samp> (simple values identified by 20..23)</li>
<li>integer and floating-point values with a larger range and precision than the above (tag numbers 2 to 5)</li>
<li>application data types such as a point in time or an RFC 3339 date/time string (tag numbers 1, 0)</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.3">Further elements of the extended generic data model can be (and have been) defined via the IANA registries created for CBOR.  Even if such an extension is unknown to a generic encoder or decoder, data items using that extension can be passed to or from the application by representing them at the interface to the application within the basic generic data model, i.e., as generic simple values or generic tags.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.4">In other words, the basic generic data model is stable as defined in this document, while the extended generic data model expands by the registration of new simple values or tag numbers, but never shrinks.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.5">While there is a strong expectation that generic encoders and decoders can represent <samp>false</samp>, <samp>true</samp>, and <samp>null</samp> (<samp>undefined</samp> is intentionally omitted) in the form appropriate for their programming environment, implementation of the data model extensions created by tags is truly optional and a matter of implementation quality.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.2.2">2.2.</a> <a href="#specific-data-models" id="specific-data-models">Specific Data Models</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.1">The specific data model for a CBOR-based protocol usually subsets the extended generic data model and assigns application semantics to the data items within this subset and its components.  When documenting such specific data models, where it is desired to specify the types of data items, it is preferred to identify the types by the names they have in the generic data model (&#8220;negative integer&#8221;, &#8220;array&#8221;) instead of by referring to aspects of their CBOR representation (&#8220;major type 1&#8221;, &#8220;major type 4&#8221;).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.2">Specific data models can also specify what values (including values of different types) are equivalent for the purposes of map keys and encoder freedom. For example, in the generic data model, a valid map MAY have both <samp>0</samp> and <samp>0.0</samp> as keys, and an encoder MUST NOT encode <samp>0.0</samp> as an integer (major type 0, <a href="#majortypes" class="xref">Section 3.1</a>).  However, if a specific data model declares that floating-point and integer representations of integral values are equivalent, using both map keys <samp>0</samp> and <samp>0.0</samp> in a single map would be considered duplicates, even while encoded as different major types, and so invalid; and an encoder could encode integral-valued floats as integers or vice versa, perhaps to save encoded bytes.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.3">3.</a> <a href="#encoding" id="encoding">Specification of the CBOR Encoding</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">A CBOR data item (<a href="#cbor-data-models" class="xref">Section 2</a>) is encoded to or decoded from a byte string carrying a well-formed encoded data item as described in this section.  The encoding is summarized in <a href="#jumptable" class="xref">Table 7</a>, indexed by the initial byte.  An encoder MUST produce only well-formed encoded data items.  A decoder MUST NOT return a decoded data item when it encounters input that is not a well-formed encoded CBOR data item (this does not detract from the usefulness of diagnostic and recovery tools that might make available some information from a damaged encoded CBOR data item).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.2">The initial byte of each encoded data item contains both information about the major type (the high-order 3 bits, described in <a href="#majortypes" class="xref">Section 3.1</a>) and additional information (the low-order 5 bits).  With a few exceptions, the additional information&#8217;s value describes how to load an unsigned integer &#8220;argument&#8221;:</p>
<p></p>

<dl>
<dt>Less than 24:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The argument&#8217;s value is the value of the additional information.</dd>
<dt>24, 25, 26, or 27:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The argument&#8217;s value is held in the following 1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes, respectively, in network byte order.  For major type 7 and additional information value 25, 26, 27, these bytes are not used as an integer argument, but as a floating-point value (see <a href="#fpnocont" class="xref">Section 3.3</a>).</dd>
<dt>28, 29, 30:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">These values are reserved for future additions to the CBOR format.  In the present version of CBOR, the encoded item is not well-formed.</dd>
<dt>31:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">No argument value is derived.  If the major type is 0, 1, or 6, the encoded item is not well-formed.  For major types 2 to 5, the item&#8217;s length is indefinite, and for major type 7, the byte does not consitute a data item at all but terminates an indefinite length item; both are described in <a href="#indefinite" class="xref">Section 3.2</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.4">The initial byte and any additional bytes consumed to construct the argument are collectively referred to as the &#8220;head&#8221; of the data item.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.5">The meaning of this argument depends on the major type.  For example, in major type 0, the argument is the value of the data item itself (and in major type 1 the value of the data item is computed from the argument); in major type 2 and 3 it gives the length of the string data in bytes that follows; and in major types 4 and 5 it is used to determine the number of data items enclosed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.6">If the encoded sequence of bytes ends before the end of a data item, that item is not well-formed. If the encoded sequence of bytes still has bytes remaining after the outermost encoded item is decoded, that encoding is not a single well-formed CBOR item; depending on the application, the decoder may either treat the encoding as not well-formed or just identify the start of the remaining bytes to the application.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.7">A CBOR decoder implementation can be based on a jump table with all 256 defined values for the initial byte (<a href="#jumptable" class="xref">Table 7</a>).  A decoder in a constrained implementation can instead use the structure of the initial byte and following bytes for more compact code (see <a href="#pseudocode" class="xref">Appendix C</a> for a rough impression of how this could look).</p>

<p></p>

<dl>
<dt>Major type 0:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">an integer in the range 0..2**64-1 inclusive.  The value of the encoded item is the argument itself.  For example, the integer 10 is denoted as the one byte 0b000_01010 (major type 0, additional information 10).  The integer 500 would be 0b000_11001 (major type 0, additional information 25) followed by the two bytes 0x01f4, which is 500 in decimal.</dd>
<dt>Major type 1:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">a negative integer in the range -2**64..-1 inclusive.  The value of the item is -1 minus the argument.  For example, the integer -500 would be 0b001_11001 (major type 1, additional information 25) followed by the two bytes 0x01f3, which is 499 in decimal.</dd>
<dt>Major type 2:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">a byte string.  The number of bytes in the string is equal to the argument.  For example, a byte string whose length is 5 would have an initial byte of 0b010_00101 (major type 2, additional information 5 for the length), followed by 5 bytes of binary content. A byte string whose length is 500 would have 3 initial bytes of 0b010_11001 (major type 2, additional information 25 to indicate a two-byte length) followed by the two bytes 0x01f4 for a length of 500, followed by 500 bytes of binary content.</dd>
<dt>Major type 3:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">a text string (<a href="#cbor-data-models" class="xref">Section 2</a>), encoded as UTF-8 (<a href="#RFC3629" class="xref">[RFC3629]</a>). The number of bytes in the string is equal to the argument.  A string containing an invalid UTF-8 sequence is well-formed but invalid (<a href="#terminology" class="xref">Section 1.2</a>). This type is provided for systems that need to interpret or display human-readable text, and allows the differentiation between unstructured bytes and text that has a specified repertoire and encoding.  In contrast to formats such as JSON, the Unicode characters in this type are never escaped. Thus, a newline character (U+000A) is always represented in a string as the byte 0x0a, and never as the bytes 0x5c6e (the characters &#8220;\&#8221; and &#8220;n&#8221;) or as 0x5c7530303061 (the characters &#8220;\&#8221;, &#8220;u&#8221;, &#8220;0&#8221;, &#8220;0&#8221;, &#8220;0&#8221;, and &#8220;a&#8221;).</dd>
<dt>Major type 4:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">an array of data items.  In other formats, arrays are also called lists, sequences, or tuples (a &#8220;CBOR sequence&#8221; is something slightly different, though <a href="#RFC8742" class="xref">[RFC8742]</a>).  The argument is the number of data items in the array.  Items in an array do not need to all be of the same type.  For example, an array that contains 10 items of any type would have an initial byte of 0b100_01010 (major type 4, additional information 10 for the length) followed by the 10 remaining items.</dd>
<dt>Major type 5:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">a map of pairs of data items. Maps are also called tables, dictionaries, hashes, or objects (in JSON).  A map is comprised of pairs of data items, each pair consisting of a key that is immediately followed by a value.  The argument is the number of <em>pairs</em> of data items in the map.  For example, a map that contains 9 pairs would have an initial byte of 0b101_01001 (major type 5, additional information 9 for the number of pairs) followed by the 18 remaining items. The first item is the first key, the second item is the first value, the third item is the second key, and so on.  Because items in a map come in pairs, their total number is always even:  A map that contains an odd number of items (no value data present after the last key data item) is not well-formed.  A map that has duplicate keys may be well-formed, but it is not valid, and thus it causes indeterminate decoding; see also <a href="#map-keys" class="xref">Section 5.6</a>.</dd>
<dt>Major type 6:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">a tagged data item (&#8220;tag&#8221;) whose tag number, an integer in the range 0..2**64-1 inclusive, is the argument and whose enclosed data item (&#8220;tag content&#8221;) is the single encoded data item that follows the head.  See <a href="#tags" class="xref">Section 3.4</a>.</dd>
<dt>Major type 7:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">floating-point numbers and simple values, as well as the &#8220;break&#8221; stop code.  See <a href="#fpnocont" class="xref">Section 3.3</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.3">These eight major types lead to a simple table showing which of the 256 possible values for the initial byte of a data item are used (<a href="#jumptable" class="xref">Table 7</a>).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.4">In major types 6 and 7, many of the possible values are reserved for future specification. See <a href="#ianacons" class="xref">Section 9</a> for more information on these values.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.1">Four CBOR items (arrays, maps, byte strings, and text strings) can be encoded with an indefinite length using additional information value 31.  This is useful if the encoding of the item needs to begin before the number of items inside the array or map, or the total length of the string, is known.  (The ability to start sending a data item before all of it is known is often referred to as &#8220;streaming&#8221; within that data item.)</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.2">Indefinite-length arrays and maps are dealt with differently than indefinite-length byte strings and text strings.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.3.2.1">3.2.1.</a> <a href="#break" id="break">The &#8220;break&#8221; Stop Code</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.1.p.1">The &#8220;break&#8221; stop code is encoded with major type 7 and additional information value 31 (0b111_11111). It is not itself a data item: it is just a syntactic feature to close an indefinite-length item.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.1.p.2">If the &#8220;break&#8221; stop code appears anywhere where a data item is expected, other than directly inside an indefinite-length string, array, or map &#8212; for example directly inside a definite-length array or map &#8212; the enclosing item is not well-formed.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.2.p.1">Indefinite-length arrays and maps are represented using their major type with the additional information value of 31, followed by an arbitrary-length sequence of zero or more items for an array or key/value pairs for a map, followed by the &#8220;break&#8221; stop code (<a href="#break" class="xref">Section 3.2.1</a>).  In other words, indefinite-length arrays and maps look identical to other arrays and maps except for beginning with the additional information value of 31 and ending with the &#8220;break&#8221; stop code.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.2.p.2">If the &#8220;break&#8221; stop code appears after a key in a map, in place of that key&#8217;s value, the map is not well-formed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.2.p.3">There is no restriction against nesting indefinite-length array or map items.  A &#8220;break&#8221; only terminates a single item, so nested indefinite-length items need exactly as many &#8220;break&#8221; stop codes as there are type bytes starting an indefinite-length item.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.2.p.4">For example, assume an encoder wants to represent the abstract array [1, [2, 3], [4, 5]].  The definite-length encoding would be 0x8301820203820405:</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.3.p.1">Indefinite-length strings are represented by a byte containing the major type and additional information value of 31, followed by a series of zero or more byte or text strings (&#8220;chunks&#8221;) that have definite lengths, followed by the &#8220;break&#8221; stop code (<a href="#break" class="xref">Section 3.2.1</a>).  The data item represented by the indefinite-length string is the concatenation of the chunks (i.e., the empty byte or text string, respectively, if no chunk is present).  (Note that zero-length chunks, while not particularly useful, are permitted.)</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.3.p.2">If any item between the indefinite-length string indicator (0b010_11111 or 0b011_11111) and the &#8220;break&#8221; stop code is not a definite-length string item of the same major type, the string is not well-formed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.3.p.3">The design does not allow nesting indefinite-length strings as chunks into indefinite-length strings.  If it were allowed, it would require decoder implementations to keep a stack, or at least a count, of nesting levels.  It is unnecessary on the encoder side because the inner indefinite-length string would consist of chunks, and these could instead be put directly into the outer indefinite-length string.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.3.p.4">If any definite-length text string inside an indefinite-length text string is invalid, the indefinite-length text string is invalid.  Note that this implies that the UTF-8 bytes of a single Unicode code point (scalar value) cannot be spread between chunks: a new chunk of a text string can only be started at a code point boundary.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.3.p.5">For example, assume an encoded data item consisting of the bytes:</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.3.p.6">0b010_11111 0b010_00100 0xaabbccdd 0b010_00011 0xeeff99 0b111_11111</p>
<pre>
5F              -- Start indefinite-length byte string
   44           -- Byte string of length 4
      aabbccdd  -- Bytes content
   43           -- Byte string of length 3
      eeff99    -- Bytes content
   FF           -- "break"
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.3.p.7">After decoding, this results in a single byte string with seven bytes: 0xaabbccddeeff99.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.3.4">3.4.</a> <a href="#tags" id="tags">Tagging of Items</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.p.1">In CBOR, a data item can be enclosed by a tag to give it some additional semantics, as uniquely identified by a &#8220;tag number&#8221;.  The tag is major type 6, its argument (<a href="#encoding" class="xref">Section 3</a>) indicates the tag number, and it contains a single enclosed data item, the &#8220;tag content&#8221;.  (If a tag requires further structure to its content, this structure is provided by the enclosed data item.) We use the term &#8220;tag&#8221; for the entire data item consisting of both a tag number and the tag content: the tag content is the data item that is being tagged.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.p.2">For example, assume that a byte string of length 12 is marked with a tag of number 2 to indicate it is a positive &#8220;bignum&#8221; (<a href="#bignums" class="xref">Section 3.4.3</a>).  The encoded data item would start with a byte 0b110_00010 (major type 6, additional information 2 for the tag number) followed by the encoded tag content: 0b010_01100 (major type 2, additional information of 12 for the length) followed by the 12 bytes of the bignum.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.p.3">The definition of a tag number describes the additional semantics conveyed for tags with this tag number in the extended generic data model.  These semantics may include equivalence of some tagged data items with other data items, including some that can already be represented in the basic generic data model.  For instance, 0xc24101, a bignum the tag content of which is the byte string with the single byte 0x01, is equivalent to an integer 1, which could also be encoded for instance as 0x01, 0x1801, or 0x190001.  The tag definition may include the definition of a preferred serialization (<a href="#preferred" class="xref">Section 4.1</a>) that is recommended for generic encoders; this may prefer basic generic data model representations over ones that employ a tag.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.p.4">The tag definition usually restricts what kinds of nested data item or items are valid for such tags.  Tag definitions may restrict their content to a very specific syntactic structure, as the tags defined in this document do, or they may aim at a more semantically defined definition of their content, as for instance tags 40 and 1040 do <a href="#RFC8746" class="xref">[RFC8746]</a>: These accept a number of different ways of representing arrays.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.p.5">As a matter of convention, many tags do not accept null or undefined values as tag content; instead, the expectation is that a null or undefined value can be used in place of the entire tag; <a href="#epochdatetimesect" class="xref">Section 3.4.2</a> provides some further considerations for one specific tag about the handling of this convention in application protocols and in mapping to platform types.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.p.6">Decoders do not need to understand tags of every tag number, and tags may be of little value in applications where the implementation creating a particular CBOR data item and the implementation decoding that stream know the semantic meaning of each item in the data flow. Their primary purpose in this specification is to define common data types such as dates. A secondary purpose is to provide conversion hints when it is foreseen that the CBOR data item needs to be translated into a different format, requiring hints about the content of items.  Understanding the semantics of tags is optional for a decoder; it can simply present both the tag number and the tag content to the application, without interpreting the additional semantics of the tag.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.p.7">A tag applies semantics to the data item it encloses.  Tags can nest:  If tag A encloses tag B, which encloses data item C, tag A applies to the result of applying tag B on data item C.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.p.8">IANA maintains a registry of tag numbers as described in <a href="#ianatags" class="xref">Section 9.2</a>.  <a href="#tagvalues" class="xref">Table 5</a> provides a list of tag numbers that were defined in <a href="#RFC7049" class="xref">[RFC7049]</a>, with definitions in the rest of this section.  Note that many other tag numbers have been defined since the publication of <a href="#RFC7049" class="xref">[RFC7049]</a>; see the registry described at <a href="#ianatags" class="xref">Section 9.2</a> for the complete list.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.4.p.9">Conceptually, tags are interpreted in the generic data model, not at (de-)serialization time.  A small number of tags (at this time, tag number 25 and tag number 29) have been registered with semantics that may require processing at (de-)serialization time: The decoder needs to be aware and the encoder needs to be in control of the exact sequence in which data items are encoded into the CBOR data item.  This means these tags cannot be implemented on top of an arbitrary generic CBOR encoder/decoder (which might not reflect the serialization order for entries in a map at the data model level and vice versa); their implementation therefore typically needs to be integrated into the generic encoder/decoder.  The definition of new tags with this property is NOT RECOMMENDED.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.p.10">IANA allocated tag numbers 65535, 4294967295, and 18446744073709551615 (binary all-ones in 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit).  These can be used as a convenience for implementers that want a single integer data structure to indicate either that a specific tag is present, or the absence of a tag.  That allocation is described in Section 10 of <a href="#I-D.bormann-cbor-notable-tags" class="xref">[I-D.bormann-cbor-notable-tags]</a>.  These tags are not intended to occur in actual CBOR data items; implementations MAY flag such an occurrence as an error.</p>

(POSIX time is also known as UNIX Epoch time.  Note that leap seconds are handled specially by POSIX time and this results in a 1 second discontinuity several times per decade.) Note that applications that require the expression of times beyond early 2106 cannot leave out support of 64-bit integers for the tag content.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.2.p.4">Negative values (major type 1 and negative floating-point numbers) are interpreted as determined by the application requirements as there is no universal standard for UTC count-of-seconds time before 1970-01-01T00:00Z (this is particularly true for points in time that precede discontinuities in national calendars).  The same applies to non-finite values.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.2.p.5">To indicate fractional seconds, floating-point values can be used within tag number 1 instead of integer values.  Note that this generally requires binary64 support, as binary16 and binary32 provide non-zero fractions of seconds only for a short period of time around early 1970.  An application that requires tag number 1 support may restrict the tag content to be an integer (or a floating-point value) only.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.2.p.6">Note that platform types for date/time may include null or undefined values, which may also be desirable at an application protocol level.  While emitting tag number 1 values with non-finite tag content values (e.g., with NaN for undefined date/time values or with Infinite for an expiry date that is not set) may seem an obvious way to handle this, using untagged null or undefined avoids the use of non-finites and results in a shorter encoding.  Application protocol designers are encouraged to consider these cases and include clear guidelines for handling them.</p>

In the basic generic data model, bignum values are not equal to integers from the same model, but the extended generic data model created by this tag definition defines equivalence based on numeric value, and preferred serialization (<a href="#preferred" class="xref">Section 4.1</a>) never makes use of bignums that also can be expressed as basic integers (see below).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.3.p.2">Bignums are encoded as a byte string data item, which is interpreted as an unsigned integer n in network byte order.  Contained items of other types are invalid.  For tag number 2, the value of the bignum is n.  For tag number 3, the value of the bignum is -1 - n.  The preferred serialization of the byte string is to leave out any leading zeroes (note that this means the preferred serialization for n&#160;=&#160;0 is the empty byte string, but see below).  Decoders that understand these tags MUST be able to decode bignums that do have leading zeroes.  The preferred serialization of an integer that can be represented using major type 0 or 1 is to encode it this way instead of as a bignum (which means that the empty string never occurs in a bignum when using preferred serialization).  Note that this means the non-preferred choice of a bignum representation instead of a basic integer for encoding a number is not intended to have application semantics (just as the choice of a longer basic integer representation than needed, such as 0x1800 for 0x00 does not).</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.4.5.2.p.1">Tags number 21 to 23 indicate that a byte string might require a specific encoding when interoperating with a text-based representation.  These tags are useful when an encoder knows that the byte string data it is writing is likely to be later converted to a particular JSON-based usage. That usage specifies that some strings are encoded as base64, base64url, and so on. The encoder uses byte strings instead of doing the encoding itself to reduce the message size, to reduce the code size of the encoder, or both.  The encoder does not know whether or not the converter will be generic, and therefore wants to say what it believes is the proper way to convert binary strings to JSON.</p>

However, there may be applications where such context information is not available, such as when CBOR data is stored in a file that does not have disambiguating metadata.

<p id="rfc.section.3.4.6.p.2">Tag number 55799 is defined for this purpose, specifically for use at the start of a stored encoded CBOR data item as specified by an application.

<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.1">For some values at the data model level, CBOR provides multiple serializations.  For many applications, it is desirable that an encoder always chooses a preferred serialization (preferred encoding); however, the present specification does not put the burden of enforcing this preference on either encoder or decoder.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.2">Some constrained decoders may be limited in their ability to decode non-preferred serializations:  For example, if only integers below 1_000_000_000 (one billion) are expected in an application, the decoder may leave out the code that would be needed to decode 64-bit arguments in integers.  An encoder that always uses preferred serialization (&#8220;preferred encoder&#8221;) interoperates with this decoder for the numbers that can occur in this application.  More generally speaking, it therefore can be said that a preferred encoder is more universally interoperable (and also less wasteful) than one that, say, always uses 64-bit integers.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.3">Similarly, a constrained encoder may be limited in the variety of representation variants it supports in such a way that it does not emit preferred serializations (&#8220;variant encoder&#8221;): Say, it could be designed to always use the 32-bit variant for an integer that it encodes even if a short representation is available (again, assuming that there is no application need for integers that can only be represented with the 64-bit variant).  A decoder that does not rely on only ever receiving preferred serializations (&#8220;variation-tolerant decoder&#8221;) can there be said to be more universally interoperable (it might very well optimize for the case of receiving preferred serializations, though).  Full implementations of CBOR decoders are by definition variation-tolerant; the distinction is only relevant if a constrained implementation of a CBOR decoder meets a variant encoder.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.4">The preferred serialization always uses the shortest form of representing the argument (<a href="#encoding" class="xref">Section 3</a>); it also uses the shortest floating-point encoding that preserves the value being encoded.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.5">The preferred serialization for a floating-point value is the shortest floating-point encoding that preserves its value, e.g., 0xf94580 for the number 5.5, and 0xfa45ad9c00 for the number 5555.5.  For NaN values, a shorter encoding is preferred if zero-padding the shorter significand towards the right reconstitutes the original NaN value (for many applications, the single NaN encoding 0xf97e00 will suffice).</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.2.1.p.1">A CBOR encoding satisfies the &#8220;core deterministic encoding requirements&#8221; if it satisfies the following restrictions:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Preferred serialization MUST be used.  In particular, this means that arguments (see <a href="#encoding" class="xref">Section 3</a>) for integers, lengths in major types 2 through 5, and tags MUST be as short as possible, for instance:  <ul>
<li>0 to 23 and -1 to -24 MUST be expressed in the same byte as the major type;</li>
<li>24 to 255 and -25 to -256 MUST be expressed only with an additional uint8_t;</li>
<li>256 to 65535 and -257 to -65536 MUST be expressed only with an additional uint16_t;</li>
<li>65536 to 4294967295 and -65537 to -4294967296 MUST be expressed only with an additional uint32_t.</li>
</ul>
<p> Floating-point values also MUST use the shortest form that preserves the value, e.g. 1.5 is encoded as 0xf93e00 and 1000000.5 as 0xfa49742408.  (One implementation of this is to have all floats start as a 64-bit float, then do a test conversion to a 32-bit float; if the result is the same numeric value, use the shorter form and repeat the process with a test conversion to a 16-bit float.  This also works to select 16-bit float for positive and negative Infinity as well.)</p>
</li>
<li>Indefinite-length items MUST NOT appear. They can be encoded as definite-length items instead.</li>
<li>The keys in every map MUST be sorted in the bytewise lexicographic order of their deterministic encodings. For example, the following keys are sorted correctly:  <ol>
<li>10, encoded as 0x0a.</li>
<li>100, encoded as 0x1864.</li>
<li>-1, encoded as 0x20.</li>
<li>&#8220;z&#8221;, encoded as 0x617a.</li>

<li>[100], encoded as 0x811864.</li>
<li>[-1], encoded as 0x8120.</li>
<li>false, encoded as 0xf4.</li>
</ol>
<p> (Implementation note: the self-delimiting nature of the CBOR encoding means that there are no two well-formed CBOR encoded data items where one is a prefix of the other.  The bytewise lexicographic comparison of deterministic encodings of different map keys therefore always ends in a position where the byte differs between the keys, before the end of a key is reached.)</p>

If a CBOR-based protocol were to provide the same semantics for the presence and absence of a specific tag (e.g., by allowing both tag 1 data items and raw numbers in a date/time position, treating the latter as if they were tagged), the deterministic format would not allow the presence of the tag, based on the &#8220;shortest form&#8221; principle.  For example, a protocol might give encoders the choice of representing a URL as either a text string or, using <a href="#encodedtext" class="xref">Section 3.4.5.3</a>, tag number 32 containing a text string. This protocol&#8217;s deterministic encoding needs to either require that the tag is present or require that it is absent, not allow either one.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.2.p.2">In a protocol that does require tags in certain places to obtain specific semantics, the tag needs to appear in the deterministic format as well.  Deterministic encoding considerations also apply to the content of tags.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.2.p.3">If a protocol includes a field that can express integers with an absolute value of 2^64 or larger using tag numbers 2 or 3 (<a href="#bignums" class="xref">Section 3.4.3</a>), the protocol&#8217;s deterministic encoding needs to specify whether smaller integers are also expressed using these tags or using major types 0 and 1.  Preferred serialization uses the latter choice, which is therefore recommended.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.2.p.4">Protocols that include floating-point values, whether represented using basic floating-point values (<a href="#fpnocont" class="xref">Section 3.3</a>) or using tags (or both), may need to define extra requirements on their deterministic encodings, such as:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Although IEEE floating-point values can represent both positive and negative zero as distinct values, the application might not distinguish these and might decide to represent all zero values with a positive sign, disallowing negative zero.  (The application may also want to restrict the precision of floating point values in such a way that there is never a need to represent 64-bit &#8212; or even 32-bit &#8212; floating-point values.)</li>
<li>If a protocol includes a field that can express floating-point values, with a specific data model that declares integer and floating-point values to be interchangeable, the protocol&#8217;s deterministic encoding needs to specify whether (for example) the integer 1.0 is encoded as 0x01, 0xf93c00, 0xfa3f800000, or 0xfb3ff0000000000000. Example rules for this are: <ol>
<li>Encode integral values that fit in 64 bits as values from major types 0 and 1, and other values as the preferred (smallest of 16-, 32-, or 64-bit) floating-point representation that accurately represents the value,</li>
<li>Encode all values as the preferred floating-point representation that accurately represents the value, even for integral values, or</li>
<li>Encode all values as 64-bit floating-point representations.</li>
</ol>
<p> Rule 1 straddles the boundaries between integers and floating-point values, and Rule 3 does not use preferred serialization, so Rule 2 may be a good choice in many cases.</p>
</li>
<li>If NaN is an allowed value and there is no intent to support NaN payloads or signaling NaNs, the protocol needs to pick a single representation, typically 0xf97e00.  If that simple choice is not possible, specific attention will be needed for NaN handling.</li>
<li>Subnormal numbers (nonzero numbers with the lowest possible exponent of a given IEEE 754 number format) may be flushed to zero outputs or be treated as zero inputs in some floating-point implementations.  A protocol&#8217;s deterministic encoding may want to specifically accommodate such implementations while creating an onus on other implementations, by excluding subnormal numbers from interchange, interchanging zero instead.</li>
<li>The same number can be represented by different decimal fractions, by different bigfloats, and by different forms under other tags that may be defined to express numeric values. Depending on the implementation, it may not always be practical to determine whether any of these forms (or forms in the basic generic data model) are equivalent.  An application protocol that presents choices of this kind for the representation format of numbers needs to be explicit in how the formats are to be chosen for deterministic encoding.</li>

For example, an agreed-to format might be &#8220;the item is an array whose first value is a UTF-8 string, second value is an integer, and subsequent values are zero or more floating-point numbers&#8221; or &#8220;the item is a map that has byte strings for keys and contains a pair whose key is 0xab01&#8221;.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.3">CBOR-based protocols MUST specify how their decoders handle invalid and other unexpected data.  CBOR-based protocols MAY specify that they treat arbitrary valid data as unexpected.  Encoders for CBOR-based protocols MUST produce only valid items, that is, the protocol cannot be designed to make use of invalid items.  An encoder can be capable of encoding as many or as few types of values as is required by the protocol in which it is used; a decoder can be capable of understanding as many or as few types of values as is required by the protocols in which it is used. This lack of restrictions allows CBOR to be used in extremely constrained environments.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.2">Not all of the bytes making up a data item may be immediately available to the decoder; some decoders will buffer additional data until a complete data item can be presented to the application.  Other decoders can present partial information about a top-level data item to an application, such as the nested data items that could already be decoded, or even parts of a byte string that hasn&#8217;t completely arrived yet.  Such an application also MUST have matching streaming security mechanism, where the desired protection is available for incremental data presented to the application.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.3">Note that some applications and protocols will not want to use indefinite-length encoding.

<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.1">A decoder with validity checking will expend the effort to reliably detect data items with validity errors. For example, such a decoder needs to have an API that reports an error (and does not return data) for a CBOR data item that contains any of the validity errors listed in the previous subsection.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.2">The set of tags defined in the tag registry (<a href="#ianatags" class="xref">Section 9.2</a>), as well as the set of simple values defined in the simple values registry (<a href="#ianasimple" class="xref">Section 9.1</a>), can grow at any time beyond the set understood by a generic decoder.  A validity-checking decoder can do one of two things when it encounters such a case that it does not recognize:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>It can report an error (and not return data).  Note that treating this case as an error can cause ossification, and is thus not encouraged. This error is not a validity error per se.  This kind of error is more likely to be raised by a decoder that would be performing validity checking if this were a known case.</li>
<li>It can emit the unknown item (type, value, and, for tags, the decoded tagged data item) to the application calling the decoder, with an indication that the decoder did not recognize that tag number or simple value.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.4">The latter approach, which is also appropriate for decoders that do not support validity checking, provides forward compatibility with newly registered tags and simple values without the requirement to update the encoder at the same time as the calling application.  (For this, the API for the decoder needs to have a way to mark unknown items so that the calling application can handle them in a manner appropriate for the program.)</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.5">Since some of the processing needed for validity checking may have an appreciable cost (in particular with duplicate detection for maps), support of validity checking is not a requirement placed on all CBOR decoders.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.5.p.1">CBOR-based protocols should take into account that different language environments pose different restrictions on the range and precision of numbers that are representable.  For example, the basic JavaScript number system treats all numbers as floating-point values, which may result in silent loss of precision in decoding integers with more than 53 significant bits.  A protocol that uses numbers should define its expectations on the handling of non-trivial numbers in decoders and receiving applications.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.p.2">A CBOR-based protocol that includes floating-point numbers can restrict which of the three formats (half-precision, single-precision, and double-precision) are to be supported.  For an integer-only application, a protocol may want to completely exclude the use of floating-point values.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.p.3">A CBOR-based protocol designed for compactness may want to exclude specific integer encodings that are longer than necessary for the application, such as to save the need to implement 64-bit integers.  There is an expectation that encoders will use the most compact integer representation that can represent a given value.  However, a compact application that does not require deterministic encoding should accept values that use a longer-than-needed encoding (such as encoding &#8220;0&#8221; as 0b000_11001 followed by two bytes of 0x00) as long as the application can decode an integer of the given size.  Similar considerations apply to floating-point values; decoding both preferred serializations and longer-than-needed ones is recommended.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.p.4">CBOR-based protocols for constrained applications that provide a choice between representing a specific number as an integer and as a decimal fraction or bigfloat (such as when the exponent is small and non-negative), might express a quality-of-implementation expectation that the integer representation is used directly.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.5.6">5.6.</a> <a href="#map-keys" id="map-keys">Specifying Keys for Maps</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.6.p.1">The encoding and decoding applications need to agree on what types of keys are going to be used in maps.  In applications that need to interwork with JSON-based applications, conversion is simplified by limiting keys to text strings only; otherwise, there has to be a specified mapping from the other CBOR types to text strings, and this often leads to implementation errors.  In applications where keys are numeric in nature and numeric ordering of keys is important to the application, directly using the numbers for the keys is useful.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.6.p.2">If multiple types of keys are to be used, consideration should be given to how these types would be represented in the specific programming environments that are to be used.  For example, in JavaScript Maps <a href="#ECMA262" class="xref">[ECMA262]</a>, a key of integer 1 cannot be distinguished from a key of floating-point 1.0. This means that, if integer keys are used, the protocol needs to avoid use of floating-point keys the values of which happen to be integer numbers in the same map.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.6.p.3">Decoders that deliver data items nested within a CBOR data item immediately on decoding them (&#8220;streaming decoders&#8221;) often do not keep the state that is necessary to ascertain uniqueness of a key in a map.  Similarly, an encoder that can start encoding data items before the enclosing data item is completely available (&#8220;streaming encoder&#8221;) may want to reduce its overhead significantly by relying on its data source to maintain uniqueness.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.6.p.4">A CBOR-based protocol MUST define what to do when a receiving application does see multiple identical keys in a map.  The resulting rule in the protocol MUST respect the CBOR data model: it cannot prescribe a specific handling of the entries with the identical keys, except that it might have a rule that having identical keys in a map indicates a malformed map and that the decoder has to stop with an error.  When processing maps that exhibit entries with duplicate keys, a generic decoder might do one of the following:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Not accept maps duplicate keys (that is, enforce validity for maps, see also <a href="#validity-checking" class="xref">Section 5.4</a>).  These generic decoders are universally useful.  An application may still need to do perform its own duplicate checking based on application rules (for instance if the application equates integers and floating point values in map key positions for specific maps).</li>
<li>Pass all map entries to the application, including ones with duplicate keys.  This requires the application to handle (check against) duplicate keys, even if the application rules are identical to the generic data model rules.</li>
<li>Lose some entries with duplicate keys, e.g. by only delivering the final (or first) entry out of the entries with the same key.  With such a generic decoder, applications may get different results for a specific key on different runs and with different generic decoders as which value is returned is based on generic decoder implementation and the actual order of keys in the map.  In particular, applications cannot validate key uniqueness on their own as they do not necessarily see all entries; they may not be able to use such a generic decoder if they do need to validate key uniqueness.  These generic decoders can only be used in situations where the data source and transfer can be relied upon to always provide valid maps; this is not possible if the data source and transfer can be attacked.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.5.6.p.6">Generic decoders need to document which of these three approaches they implement.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.6.p.7">The CBOR data model for maps does not allow ascribing semantics to the order of the key/value pairs in the map representation.  Thus, a CBOR-based protocol MUST NOT specify that changing the key/value pair order in a map would change the semantics, except to specify that some orders are disallowed, for example where they would not meet the requirements of a deterministic encoding (<a href="#det-enc" class="xref">Section 4.2</a>).  (Any secondary effects of map ordering such as on timing, cache usage, and other potential side channels are not considered part of the semantics but may be enough reason on their own for a protocol to require a deterministic encoding format.)</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.6.p.8">Applications for constrained devices that have maps where a small number of frequently used keys can be identified should consider using small integers as keys; for instance, a set of 24 or fewer frequent keys can be encoded in a single byte as unsigned integers, up to 48 if negative integers are also used.  Less frequently occurring keys can then use integers with longer encodings.</p>

Note that JSON requires escaping certain characters (<a href="#RFC8259" class="xref">[RFC8259]</a>, Section 7): quotation mark (U+0022), reverse solidus (U+005C), and the &#8220;C0 control characters&#8221; (U+0000 through U+001F).  All other characters are copied unchanged into the JSON UTF-8 string.</li>
<li>An array (major type 4) becomes a JSON array.</li>
<li>A map (major type 5) becomes a JSON object.  This is possible directly only if all keys are UTF-8 strings.  A converter might also convert other keys into UTF-8 strings (such as by converting integers into strings containing their decimal representation); however, doing so introduces a danger of key collision.  Note also that, if tags on UTF-8 strings are ignored as proposed below, this will cause a key collision if the tags are different but the strings are the same.</li>
<li>False (major type 7, additional information 20) becomes a JSON false.</li>
<li>True (major type 7, additional information 21) becomes a JSON true.</li>
<li>Null (major type 7, additional information 22) becomes a JSON null.</li>
<li>A floating-point value (major type 7, additional information 25 through 27) becomes a JSON number if it is finite (that is, it can be represented in a JSON number); if the value is non-finite (NaN, or positive or negative Infinity), it is represented by the substitute value.</li>
<li>Any other simple value (major type 7, any additional information value not yet discussed) is represented by the substitute value.</li>
<li>A bignum (major type 6, tag number 2 or 3) is represented by encoding its byte string in base64url without padding and becomes a JSON string.  For tag number 3 (negative bignum), a &#8220;~&#8221; (ASCII tilde) is inserted before the base-encoded value. (The conversion to a binary blob instead of a number is to prevent a likely numeric overflow for the JSON decoder.)</li>
<li>A byte string with an encoding hint (major type 6, tag number 21 through 23) is encoded as described by the hint and becomes a JSON string.</li>
<li>For all other tags (major type 6, any other tag number), the tag content is represented as a JSON value; the tag number is ignored.</li>
<li>Indefinite-length items are made definite before conversion.</li>

<a href="#rfc.section.6.2">6.2.</a> <a href="#converting-from-json-to-cbor" id="converting-from-json-to-cbor">Converting from JSON to CBOR</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.1">All JSON values, once decoded, directly map into one or more CBOR values.  As with any kind of CBOR generation, decisions have to be made with respect to number representation.  In a suggested conversion:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>JSON numbers without fractional parts (integer numbers) are represented as integers (major types 0 and 1, possibly major type 6 tag number 2 and 3), choosing the shortest form; integers longer than an implementation-defined threshold may instead be represented as floating-point values.  The default range that is represented as integer is -2**53+1..2**53-1 (fully exploiting the range for exact integers in the binary64 representation often used for decoding JSON <a href="#RFC7493" class="xref">[RFC7493]</a>).  A CBOR-based protocol, or a generic converter implementation, may choose -2**32..2**32-1 or -2**64..2**64-1 (fully using the integer ranges available in CBOR with uint32_t or uint64_t, respectively) or even -2**31..2**31-1 or -2**63..2**63-1 (using popular ranges for two&#8217;s complement signed integers).  (If the JSON was generated from a JavaScript implementation, its precision is already limited to 53 bits maximum.)</li>
<li>Numbers with fractional parts are represented as floating-point values, performing the decimal-to-binary conversion based on the precision provided by IEEE 754 binary64.  The mathematical value of the JSON number is converted to binary64 using the roundTiesToEven procedure in Section 4.3.1 of <a href="#IEEE754" class="xref">[IEEE754]</a>.  Then, when encoding in CBOR, the preferred serialization uses the shortest floating-point representation exactly representing this conversion result; for instance, 1.5 is represented in a 16-bit floating-point value (not all implementations will be capable of efficiently finding the minimum form, though).  Instead of using the default binary64 precision, there may be an implementation-defined limit to the precision of the conversion that will affect the precision of the represented values. Decimal representation should only be used on the CBOR side if that is specified in a protocol.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.3">CBOR has been designed to generally provide a more compact encoding than JSON.  One implementation strategy that might come to mind is to perform a JSON-to-CBOR encoding in place in a single buffer.  This strategy would need to carefully consider a number of pathological cases, such as that some strings represented with no or very few escapes and longer (or much longer) than 255 bytes may expand when encoded as UTF-8 strings in CBOR.  Similarly, a few of the binary floating-point representations might cause expansion from some short decimal representations (1.1, 1e9) in JSON.  This may be hard to get right, and any ensuing vulnerabilities may be exploited by an attacker.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.7">7.</a> <a href="#future-evolution-of-cbor" id="future-evolution-of-cbor">Future Evolution of CBOR</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.1">Successful protocols evolve over time.  New ideas appear, implementation platforms improve, related protocols are developed and evolve, and new requirements from applications and protocols are added.  Facilitating protocol evolution is therefore an important design consideration for any protocol development.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.2">For protocols that will use CBOR, CBOR provides some useful mechanisms to facilitate their evolution.  Best practices for this are well known, particularly from JSON format development of JSON-based protocols.  Therefore, such best practices are outside the scope of this specification.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.3">However, facilitating the evolution of CBOR itself is very well within its scope.  CBOR is designed to both provide a stable basis for development of CBOR-based protocols and to be able to evolve.  Since a successful protocol may live for decades, CBOR needs to be designed for decades of use and evolution.  This section provides some guidance for the evolution of CBOR.  It is necessarily more subjective than other parts of this document.  It is also necessarily incomplete, lest it turn into a textbook on protocol development.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.1">7.1.</a> <a href="#extension-points" id="extension-points">Extension Points</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.1">In a protocol design, opportunities for evolution are often included in the form of extension points.  For example, there may be a codepoint space that is not fully allocated from the outset, and the protocol is designed to tolerate and embrace implementations that start using more codepoints than initially allocated.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.2">Sizing the codepoint space may be difficult because the range required may be hard to predict.  Protocol designs should attempt to make the codepoint space large enough so that it can slowly be filled over the intended lifetime of the protocol.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.3">CBOR has three major extension points:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>the &#8220;simple&#8221; space (values in major type 7).  Of the 24 efficient (and 224 slightly less efficient) values, only a small number have been allocated.  Implementations receiving an unknown simple data item may easily be able to process it as such, given that the structure of the value is indeed simple. The IANA registry in <a href="#ianasimple" class="xref">Section 9.1</a> is the appropriate way to address the extensibility of this codepoint space.</li>
<li>the &#8220;tag&#8221; space (values in major type 6).  The total codepoint space is abundant; only a tiny part of it has been allocated.  However, not all of these codepoints are equally efficient: the first 24 only consume a single (&#8220;1+0&#8221;) byte, and half of them have already been allocated. The next 232 values only consume two (&#8220;1+1&#8221;) bytes, with nearly a quarter already allocated.  These subspaces need some curation to last for a few more decades.  Implementations receiving an unknown tag number can choose to process just the enclosed tag content or, preferably, to process the tag as an unknown tag number wrapping the tag content. The IANA registry in <a href="#ianatags" class="xref">Section 9.2</a> is the appropriate way to address the extensibility of this codepoint space.</li>
<li>the &#8220;additional information&#8221; space.  An implementation receiving an unknown additional information value has no way to continue decoding, so allocating codepoints in this space is a major step beyond just exercising an extension point.  There are also very few codepoints left.  See also <a href="#curating" class="xref">Section 7.2</a>.</li>
</ul>

<a href="#rfc.section.7.2">7.2.</a> <a href="#curating" id="curating">Curating the Additional Information Space</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.1">The human mind is sometimes drawn to filling in little perceived gaps to make something neat.  We expect the remaining gaps in the codepoint space for the additional information values to be an attractor for new ideas, just because they are there.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.2">The present specification does not manage the additional information codepoint space by an IANA registry.  Instead, allocations out of this space can only be done by updating this specification.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.3">For an additional information value of n &gt;= 24, the size of the additional data typically is 2**(n-24) bytes.  Therefore, additional information values 28 and 29 should be viewed as candidates for 128-bit and 256-bit quantities, in case a need arises to add them to the protocol.  Additional information value 30 is then the only additional information value available for general allocation, and there should be a very good reason for allocating it before assigning it through an update of the present specification.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.8">8.</a> <a href="#diagnostic-notation" id="diagnostic-notation">Diagnostic Notation</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.1">CBOR is a binary interchange format.  To facilitate documentation and debugging, and in particular to facilitate communication between entities cooperating in debugging, this section defines a simple human-readable diagnostic notation.  All actual interchange always happens in the binary format.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.2">Note that this truly is a diagnostic format; it is not meant to be parsed.  Therefore, no formal definition (as in ABNF) is given in this document.  (Implementers looking for a text-based format for representing CBOR data items in configuration files may also want to consider YAML <a href="#YAML" class="xref">[YAML]</a>.)</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.3">The diagnostic notation is loosely based on JSON as it is defined in RFC 8259, extending it where needed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.4">The notation borrows the JSON syntax for numbers (integer and floating-point), True (&gt;true&lt;), False (&gt;false&lt;), Null (&gt;null&lt;), UTF-8 strings, arrays, and maps (maps are called objects in JSON; the diagnostic notation extends JSON here by allowing any data item in the key position).  Undefined is written &gt;undefined&lt; as in JavaScript.  The non-finite floating-point numbers Infinity, -Infinity, and NaN are written exactly as in this sentence (this is also a way they can be written in JavaScript, although JSON does not allow them).  A tag is written as an integer number for the tag number, followed by the tag content in parentheses; for instance, an RFC 3339 (ISO 8601) date could be notated as:</p>
<p></p>

<ul class="empty"><li>0(&#8220;2013-03-21T20:04:00Z&#8221;)</li></ul>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.6">or the equivalent relative time as</p>
<p></p>

<ul class="empty"><li>1(1363896240)</li></ul>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.8">Byte strings are notated in one of the base encodings, without padding, enclosed in single quotes, prefixed by &gt;h&lt; for base16, &gt;b32&lt; for base32, &gt;h32&lt; for base32hex, &gt;b64&lt; for base64 or base64url (the actual encodings do not overlap, so the string remains unambiguous).  For example, the byte string 0x12345678 could be written h&#8217;12345678&#8217;, b32&#8217;CI2FM6A&#8217;, or b64&#8217;EjRWeA&#8217;.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.9">Unassigned simple values are given as &#8220;simple()&#8221; with the appropriate integer in the parentheses. For example, &#8220;simple(42)&#8221; indicates major type 7, value 42.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.1">Sometimes it is useful to indicate in the diagnostic notation which of several alternative representations were actually used; for example, a data item written &gt;1.5&lt; by a diagnostic decoder might have been encoded as a half-, single-, or double-precision float.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.2">The convention for encoding indicators is that anything starting with an underscore and all following characters that are alphanumeric or underscore, is an encoding indicator, and can be ignored by anyone not interested in this information.  For example, <samp>_</samp> or <samp>_3</samp>.  Encoding indicators are always optional.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.3">A single underscore can be written after the opening brace of a map or the opening bracket of an array to indicate that the data item was represented in indefinite-length format.  For example, [_ 1, 2] contains an indicator that an indefinite-length representation was used to represent the data item [1, 2].</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.4">An underscore followed by a decimal digit n indicates that the preceding item (or, for arrays and maps, the item starting with the preceding bracket or brace) was encoded with an additional information value of 24+n.

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.1">A network-facing application can exhibit vulnerabilities in its processing logic for incoming data. Complex parsers are well known as a likely source of such vulnerabilities, such as the ability to remotely crash a node, or even remotely execute arbitrary code on it.  CBOR attempts to narrow the opportunities for introducing such vulnerabilities by reducing parser complexity, by giving the entire range of encodable values a meaning where possible.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.2">Because CBOR decoders are often used as a first step in processing unvalidated input, they need to be fully prepared for all types of hostile input that may be designed to corrupt, overrun, or achieve control of the system decoding the CBOR data item. A CBOR decoder needs to assume that all input may be hostile even if it has been checked by a firewall, has come over a secure channel such as TLS, is encrypted or signed, or has come from some other source that is presumed trusted.</p>
<p><a href="#preferred" class="xref">Section 4.1</a> gives examples of limitations in interoperability when using a constrained CBOR decoder with input from a CBOR encoder that uses a non-preferred serialization. When a single data item is consumed both by such a constrained decoder and a full decoder, it can lead to security issues that can be exploited by an attacker who can inject or manipulate content.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.4">As discussed throughout this document, there are many values that can be considered &#8220;equivalent&#8221; in some circumstances and &#8220;not equivalent&#8221; in others. As just one example, the numeric value for the number &#8220;one&#8221; might be expressed as an integer or a bignum. A system interpreting CBOR input might accept either form for the number &#8220;one&#8221;, or might reject one (or both) forms. Such acceptance or rejection can have security implications in the program that is using the interpreted input.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.5">Hostile input may be constructed to overrun buffers, overflow or underflow integer arithmetic, or cause other decoding disruption.  CBOR data items might have lengths or sizes that are intentionally extremely large or too short.  Resource exhaustion attacks might attempt to lure a decoder into allocating very big data items (strings, arrays, maps, or even arbitrary precision numbers) or exhaust the stack depth by setting up deeply nested items.  Decoders need to have appropriate resource management to mitigate these attacks.  (Items for which very large sizes are given can also attempt to exploit integer overflow vulnerabilities.)</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.6">A CBOR decoder, by definition, only accepts well-formed CBOR; this is the first step to its robustness.  Input that is not well-formed CBOR causes no further processing from the point where the lack of well-formedness was detected.  If possible, any data decoded up to this point should have no impact on the application using the CBOR decoder.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.7">In addition to ascertaining well-formedness, a CBOR decoder might also perform validity checks on the CBOR data.  Alternatively, it can leave those checks to the application using the decoder.  This choice needs to be clearly documented in the decoder.  Beyond the validity at the CBOR level, an application also needs to ascertain that the input is in alignment with the application protocol that is serialized in CBOR.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.8">The input check itself may consume resources.  This is usually linear in the size of the input, which means that an attacker has to spend resources that are commensurate to the resources spent by the defender on input validation.  Processing for arbitrary-precision numbers may exceed linear effort.  Also, some hash-table implementations that are used by decoders to build in-memory representations of maps can be attacked to spend quadratic effort, unless a secret key (see Section 7 of <a href="#SIPHASH_LNCS" class="xref">[SIPHASH_LNCS]</a>, also <a href="#SIPHASH_OPEN" class="xref">[SIPHASH_OPEN]</a>) or some other mitigation is employed.  Such superlinear efforts can be exploited by an attacker to exhaust resources at or before the input validator; they therefore need to be avoided in a CBOR decoder implementation.  Note that tag number definitions and their implementations can add security considerations of this kind; this should then be discussed in the security considerations of the tag number definition.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.9">CBOR encoders do not receive input directly from the network and are thus not directly attackable in the same way as CBOR decoders.  However, CBOR encoders often have an API that takes input from another level in the implementation and can be attacked through that API. The design and implementation of that API should assume the behavior of its caller may be based on hostile input or on coding mistakes. It should check inputs for buffer overruns, overflow and underflow of integer arithmetic, and other such errors that are aimed to disrupt the encoder.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.10">Protocols should be defined in such a way that potential multiple interpretations are reliably reduced to a single interpretation.  For example, an attacker could make use of invalid input such as duplicate keys in maps, or exploit different precision in processing numbers to make one application base its decisions on a different interpretation than the one that will be used by a second application.  To facilitate consistent interpretation, encoder and decoder implementations should provide a validity checking mode of operation (<a href="#validity-checking" class="xref">Section 5.4</a>).  Note, however, that a generic decoder cannot know about all requirements that an application poses on its input data; it is therefore not relieving the application from performing its own input checking.  Also, since the set of defined tag numbers evolves, the application may employ a tag number that is not yet supported for validity checking by the generic decoder it uses.  Generic decoders therefore need to provide documentation which tag numbers they support and what validity checking they can provide for each of them as well as for basic CBOR validity (UTF-8 checking, duplicate map key checking).</p>
<p><a href="#bignums" class="xref">Section 3.4.3</a> notes that using the non-preferred choice of a bignum representation instead of a basic integer for encoding a number is not intended to have application semantics, but it can have such semantics if an application receiving CBOR data is using a decoder in the basic generic data model. This disparity causes a security issue if the two sets of semantics differ. Thus, applications using CBOR need to specify the data model that they are using for each use of CBOR data.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.12">It is common to convert CBOR data to other formats. In many cases, CBOR has more expressive types than other formats; this is particularly true for the common conversion to JSON. The loss of type information can cause security issues for the systems that are processing the less-expressive data.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.13">Security considerations for the use of base16 and base64 from <a href="#RFC4648" class="xref">[RFC4648]</a>, and the use of UTF-8 from <a href="#RFC3629" class="xref">[RFC3629]</a>, are relevant to CBOR as well.</p>

<a href="#rfc.appendix.E">Appendix E.</a> <a href="#comparison-app" id="comparison-app">Comparison of Other Binary Formats to CBOR&#8217;s Design Objectives</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.E.p.1">The proposal for CBOR follows a history of binary formats that is as long as the history of computers themselves. Different formats have had different objectives. In most cases, the objectives of the format were never stated, although they can sometimes be implied by the context where the format was first used. Some formats were meant to be universally usable, although history has proven that no binary format meets the needs of all protocols and applications.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.p.2">CBOR differs from many of these formats due to it starting with a set of objectives and attempting to meet just those. This section compares a few of the dozens of formats with CBOR&#8217;s objectives in order to help the reader decide if they want to use CBOR or a different format for a particular protocol or application.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.p.3">Note that the discussion here is not meant to be a criticism of any format: to the best of our knowledge, no format before CBOR was meant to cover CBOR&#8217;s objectives in the priority we have assigned them.  A brief recap of the objectives from <a href="#objectives" class="xref">Section 1.1</a> is:</p>
<p></p>

<ol>
<li>unambiguous encoding of most common data formats from Internet standards</li>
<li>code compactness for encoder or decoder</li>
<li>no schema description needed</li>
<li>reasonably compact serialization</li>
<li>applicability to constrained and unconstrained applications</li>
<li>good JSON conversion</li>
<li>extensibility</li>
</ol>
<p id="rfc.section.E.p.5">A discussion of CBOR and other formats with respect to a different set of design objectives is provided in Section 5 and Appendix C of <a href="#RFC8618" class="xref">[RFC8618]</a>.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.E.1">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.E.1">E.1.</a> <a href="#asn1-der-ber-and-per" id="asn1-der-ber-and-per">ASN.1 DER, BER, and PER</a>

<p><a href="#ASN.1" class="xref">[ASN.1]</a> has many serializations. In the IETF, DER and BER are the most common. The serialized output is not particularly compact for many items, and the code needed to decode numeric items can be complex on a constrained device.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.1.p.2">Few (if any) IETF protocols have adopted one of the several variants of Packed Encoding Rules (PER).  There could be many reasons for this, but one that is commonly stated is that PER makes use of the schema even for parsing the surface structure of the data item, requiring significant tool support.  There are different versions of the ASN.1 schema language in use, which has also hampered adoption.</p>

</h1>
<p><a href="#MessagePack" class="xref">[MessagePack]</a> is a concise, widely implemented counted binary serialization format, similar in many properties to CBOR, although somewhat less regular.  While the data model can be used to represent JSON data, MessagePack has also been used in many remote procedure call (RPC) applications and for long-term storage of data.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.2.p.2">MessagePack has been essentially stable since it was first published around 2011; it has not yet had a transition.  The evolution of MessagePack is impeded by an imperative to maintain complete backwards compatibility with existing stored data, while only few bytecodes are still available for extension.  Repeated requests over the years from the MessagePack user community to separate out binary and text strings in the encoding recently have led to an extension proposal that would leave MessagePack&#8217;s &#8220;raw&#8221; data ambiguous between its usages for binary and text data. The extension mechanism for MessagePack remains unclear.</p>

<p><a href="#BSON" class="xref">[BSON]</a> is a data format that was developed for the storage of JSON-like maps (JSON objects) in the MongoDB database.  Its major distinguishing feature is the capability for in-place update, which prevents a compact representation.  BSON uses a counted representation except for map keys, which are null-byte terminated.  While BSON can be used for the representation of JSON-like objects on the wire, its specification is dominated by the requirements of the database application and has become somewhat baroque. The status of how BSON extensions will be implemented remains unclear.</p>

<a href="#rfc.appendix.F">Appendix F.</a> <a href="#errors" id="errors">Well-formedness errors and examples</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.F.p.1">There are three basic kinds of well-formedness errors that can occur in decoding a CBOR data item:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Too much data: There are input bytes left that were not consumed.  This is only an error if the application assumed that the input bytes would span exactly one data item.  Where the application uses the self-delimiting nature of CBOR encoding to permit additional data after the data item, as is for example done in CBOR sequences <a href="#RFC8742" class="xref">[RFC8742]</a>, the CBOR decoder can simply indicate what part of the input has not been consumed.</li>
<li>Too little data: The input data available would need additional bytes added at their end for a complete CBOR data item.  This may indicate the input is truncated; it is also a common error when trying to decode random data as CBOR.  For some applications, however, this may not actually be an error, as the application may not be certain it has all the data yet and can obtain or wait for additional input bytes.  Some of these applications may have an upper limit for how much additional data can show up; here the decoder may be able to indicate that the encoded CBOR data item cannot be completed within this limit.</li>
<li>Syntax error: The input data are not consistent with the requirements of the CBOR encoding, and this cannot be remedied by adding (or removing) data at the end.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.F.p.3">In <a href="#pseudocode" class="xref">Appendix C</a>, errors of the first kind are addressed in the first paragraph/bullet list (requiring &#8220;no bytes are left&#8221;), and errors of the second kind are addressed in the second paragraph/bullet list (failing &#8220;if n bytes are no longer available&#8221;).  Errors of the third kind are identified in the pseudocode by specific instances of calling fail(), in order:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>a reserved value is used for additional information (28, 29, 30)</li>
<li>major type 7, additional information 24, value &lt; 32 (incorrect)</li>
<li>incorrect substructure of indefinite length byte/text string (may only contain definite length strings of the same major type)</li>
<li>&#8220;break&#8221; stop code (mt=7, ai=31) occurs in a value position of a map or except at a position directly in an indefinite length item where also another enclosed data item could occur</li>
<li>additional information 31 used with major type 0, 1, or 6</li>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.F.1.p.1">This subsection shows a few examples for CBOR data items that are not well-formed.  Each example is a sequence of bytes each shown in hexadecimal; multiple examples in a list are separated by commas.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.F.1.p.2">Examples for well-formedness error kind 1 (too much data) can easily be formed by adding data to a well-formed encoded CBOR data item.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.F.1.p.3">Similarly, examples for well-formedness error kind 2 (too little data) can be formed by truncating a well-formed encoded CBOR data item.  In test suites, it may be beneficial to specifically test with incomplete data items that would require large amounts of addition to be completed (for instance by starting the encoding of a string of a very large size).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.F.1.p.4">A premature end of the input can occur in a head or within the enclosed data, which may be bare strings or enclosed data items that are either counted or should have been ended by a &#8220;break&#8221; stop code.</p>

</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.F.1.p.6">A few examples for the five subkinds of well-formedness error kind 3 (syntax error) are shown below.</p>

<a href="#rfc.appendix.G">Appendix G.</a> <a href="#changes-from-rfc-7049" id="changes-from-rfc-7049">Changes from RFC 7049</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.G.p.1">As discussed in the introduction, this document is a revised edition of RFC 7049, with editorial improvements, added detail, and fixed errata.  This document formally obsoletes RFC 7049, while keeping full compatibility of the interchange format from RFC 7049.  This document does not create a new version of the format.</p>

<a href="#rfc.appendix.G.1">G.1.</a> <a href="#errata-processing-clerical-changes" id="errata-processing-clerical-changes">Errata processing, clerical changes</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.G.1.p.1">The two verified errata on RFC 7049, EID 3764 and EID 3770, concerned two encoding examples in the text that have been corrected (<a href="#bignums" class="xref">Section 3.4.3</a>: &#8220;29&#8221; -&gt; &#8220;49&#8221;, <a href="#numbers" class="xref">Section 5.5</a>: &#8220;0b000_11101&#8221; -&gt; &#8220;0b000_11001&#8221;).  Also, RFC 7049 contained an example using the numeric value 24 for a simple value (EID 5917), which is not well-formed; this example has been removed.  Errata report 5763 pointed to an accident in the wording of the definition of tags; this was resolved during a re-write of <a href="#tags" class="xref">Section 3.4</a>.  Errata report 5434 pointed out that the UBJSON example in <a href="#comparison-app" class="xref">Appendix E</a> no longer complied with the version of UBJSON current at the time of submitting the report.  It turned out that the UBJSON specification had completely changed since 2013; this example therefore also was removed.  Further errata reports (4409, 4963, 4964) complained that the map key sorting rules for canonical encoding were onerous; these led to a reconsideration of the canonical encoding suggestions and replacement by the deterministic encoding suggestions (described below).  An editorial suggestion in errata report 4294 was also implemented (improved symmetry by adding &#8220;Second value&#8221; to a comment to the last example in <a href="#indef" class="xref">Section 3.2.2</a>).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.G.1.p.2">Other more clerical changes include:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>use of new RFCXML functionality <a href="#RFC7991" class="xref">[RFC7991]</a>;</li>
<li>explain some more of the notation used;</li>
<li>updated references, e.g. for RFC4627 to <a href="#RFC8259" class="xref">[RFC8259]</a> in many places, for CNN-TERMS to <a href="#RFC7228" class="xref">[RFC7228]</a>; added missing reference to <a href="#IEEE754" class="xref">[IEEE754]</a> (importing required definitions) and updated to <a href="#ECMA262" class="xref">[ECMA262]</a>; added a reference to <a href="#RFC8618" class="xref">[RFC8618]</a> that further illustrates the discussion in <a href="#comparison-app" class="xref">Appendix E</a>;</li>
<li>the discussion of diagnostic notation mentions the &#8220;Extended Diagnostic Notation&#8221; (EDN) defined in <a href="#RFC8610" class="xref">[RFC8610]</a>;</li>
<li>the addition of this appendix.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.G.2.p.1">The IANA considerations were generally updated (clerical changes, e.g., now pointing to the CBOR working group as the author of the specification).  References to the respective IANA registries have been added to the informative references.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.G.3.p.1">In revising the document, beyond processing errata reports, the WG could use nearly seven years of experience with the use of CBOR in a diverse set of applications.  This led to a number of editorial changes, including adding tables for illustration, but also to emphasizing some aspects and de-emphasizing others.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.G.3.p.2">A significant addition in this revision is <a href="#cbor-data-models" class="xref">Section 2</a>, which discusses the CBOR data model and its small variations involved in the processing of CBOR.  Introducing terms for those (basic generic, extended generic, specific) enables more concise language in other places of the document, but also helps in clarifying expectations on implementations and on the extensibility features of the format.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.G.3.p.3">RFC 7049, as a format derived from the JSON ecosystem, was influenced by the JSON number system that was in turn inherited from JavaScript at the time.  JSON does not provide distinct integers and floating point values (and the latter are decimal in the format).  CBOR provides binary representations of numbers, which do differ between integers and floating point values.  Experience from implementation and use now suggested that the separation between these two number domains should be more clearly drawn in the document; language that suggested an integer could seamlessly stand in for a floating point value was removed.  Also, a suggestion (based on I-JSON <a href="#RFC7493" class="xref">[RFC7493]</a>) was added for handling these types when converting JSON to CBOR.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.G.3.p.4">For a single value in the data model, CBOR often provides multiple encoding options.  The revision adds a new section <a href="#serialization-considerations" class="xref">Section 4</a>, which first introduces the term &#8220;preferred serialization&#8221; (<a href="#preferred" class="xref">Section 4.1</a>) and defines it for various kinds of data items.  On the basis of this terminology, the section goes on to discuss how a CBOR-based protocol can define &#8220;deterministic encoding&#8221; (<a href="#det-enc" class="xref">Section 4.2</a>), which now avoids the RFC 7049 terms &#8220;canonical&#8221; and &#8220;canonicalization&#8221;.  The suggestion of &#8220;Core Deterministic Encoding Requirements&#8221; <a href="#core-det" class="xref">Section 4.2.1</a> enables generic support for such protocol-defined encoding requirements.  The present revision further eases the implementation of deterministic encoding by simplifying the map ordering suggested in RFC 7049 to simple lexicographic ordering of encoded keys.  A description of the older suggestion is kept as an alternative, now termed &#8220;length-first map key ordering&#8221; (<a href="#length-first" class="xref">Section 4.2.3</a>).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.G.3.p.5">The terminology for well-formed and valid data was sharpened and more stringently used, avoiding less well-defined alternative terms such as &#8220;syntax error&#8221;, &#8220;decoding error&#8221; and &#8220;strict mode&#8221; outside examples.  Also, a third level of requirements beyond CBOR-level validity that an application has on its input data is now explicitly called out.  Well-formed (processable at all), valid (checked by a validity-checking generic decoder), and expected input (as checked by the application) are treated as a hierarchy of layers of acceptability.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.G.3.p.6">The handling of non-well-formed simple values was clarified in text and pseudocode.  <a href="#errors" class="xref">Appendix F</a> was added to discuss well-formedness errors and provide examples for them.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.G.3.p.7">The discussion of validity has been sharpened in two areas.  Map validity (handling of duplicate keys) was clarified and the domain of applicability of certain implementation choices explained.  Also, while streamlining the terminology for tags, tag numbers, and tag content, discussion was added on tag validity, and the restrictions were clarified on tag content, in general and specifically for tag 1.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.G.3.p.8">An implementation note (and note for future tag definitions) was added to <a href="#tags" class="xref">Section 3.4</a> about defining tags with semantics that depend on serialization order.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.G.3.p.9">Terminology was introduced in <a href="#encoding" class="xref">Section 3</a> for &#8220;argument&#8221; and &#8220;head&#8221;, simplifying further discussion.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.G.3.p.10">The security considerations were mostly rewritten and significantly expanded; in multiple other places, the document is now more explicit that a decoder cannot simply condone well-formedness errors.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.acknowledgements"><a href="#rfc.acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.H.p.1">CBOR was inspired by MessagePack.  MessagePack was developed and promoted by Sadayuki Furuhashi (&#8220;frsyuki&#8221;).  This reference to MessagePack is solely for attribution; CBOR is not intended as a version of or replacement for MessagePack, as it has different design goals and requirements.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.H.p.2">The need for functionality beyond the original MessagePack Specification became obvious to many people at about the same time around the year 2012.  BinaryPack is a minor derivation of MessagePack that was developed by Eric Zhang for the binaryjs project.  A similar, but different, extension was made by Tim Caswell for his msgpack-js and msgpack-js-browser projects.  Many people have contributed to the discussion about extending MessagePack to separate text string representation from byte string representation.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.H.p.3">The encoding of the additional information in CBOR was inspired by the encoding of length information designed by Klaus Hartke for CoAP.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.H.p.4">This document also incorporates suggestions made by many people, notably Dan Frost, James Manger, Jeffrey Yasskin, Joe Hildebrand, Keith Moore, Laurence Lundblade, Matthew Lepinski, Michael Richardson, Nico Williams, Peter Occil, Phillip Hallam-Baker, Ray Polk, Stuart Cheshire, Tim Bray, Tony Finch, Tony Hansen, and Yaron Sheffer.
