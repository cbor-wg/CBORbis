The WG tried to do this wherever possible. It is very difficult to do this in the
specification of a data format because most the recommendations are for application
developers, not encoder and decoder developers. The WG jiggled some of the
requirements language, and this is the best result we could come up with.

This is usful input. Many of us have been reading this for seven years...
We have taken many of your suggestions about forward references and first
definitions to heart and will put them in the document before sending it
to the RFC Editor.

Great!

[[ Lots of editorial notes elided here, but many edits were added to the
document based on them: thanks! We could not add the extensive cross-references that
were requested, but were able to add some of them to increase clarity. ]]

Definitely! See above.

As you can see at <https://www.iana.org/assignments/cbor-tags/cbor-tags.xhtml#tags>,
these are not RFCs, they are to a personal website. Instead of creating a link in an
RFC that could go stale, it is better to expect a developer who cares about the tags
to go to the IANA registry.

Already fixed; see earlier responses to Ben.

One can never predict the future, but the stability of the Unicode standard in
respect to these code points seems pretty good.

The goal of Section 4.2.1 is pretty clearly "deterministic encoding". This section
has nothing to do with the optimization of the format itself.
